# Password Generator

## Description

This project created a secure password generator using the users preferences on password length, and characters to be included. Using existing HTML, CSS, and the beginning of the Javascript code, I fleshed out the Javascript to generate a random password from the variables selected by the user.  The link to the deployed site is below:
